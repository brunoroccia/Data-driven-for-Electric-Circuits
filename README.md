# Data-Driven Computational Mechanics (DDCM) for Electric Circuits âš¡

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of a **data-driven computational framework** for the simulation of electric circuits. The approach replaces traditional constitutive models with **finite sets of data points** (synthetic or experimental), enforcing them through a feedback operator within a **variational time-integration scheme**.
