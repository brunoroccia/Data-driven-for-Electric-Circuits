# Data-driven-for-Electric-Circuits
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of a data-driven computational framework for the simulation of electric circuits. The approach replaces traditional constitutive models with finite sets of data points (synthetic or experimental), enforcing them through a feedback operator within a variational time-integration scheme.
