# Data-Driven Computational Mechanics (DDCM) for Electric Circuits âš¡

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of a **data-driven computational framework** for the simulation of electric circuits.  
The approach replaces traditional constitutive models with **finite sets of data points** (synthetic or experimental), enforcing them through a feedback operator within a **variational time-integration scheme**.

## âœ¨ Features
- Circuit assembly from **graph representations** with inductors and capacitors.  
- Non-holonomic constraints handling via reduced incidence matrices.  
- **Alternating Direction Method (ADM)** solver for DDCM applied to RLC-type networks.  
- Synthetic capacitor data generation with nonlinear effects.  
- Tools for post-processing:
  - Phase-space plots (chargeâ€“voltage pairs vs. data)  
  - Time evolution of charges  
  - Residuum, error cost, and global cost function histories
