# Data-Driven Computational Mechanics (DDCM) for Electric Circuits ⚡

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of a **data-driven computational framework** for the simulation of electric circuits. The approach replaces traditional constitutive models with **finite sets of data points** (synthetic or experimental), enforcing them through a feedback operator within a **variational time-integration scheme**.

**DDEC:** <br />
First version released on September 01, 2025.

**Warning:** <br />
It works on Matlab 7+ <br />
A technical description of the implementation can be found in the following paper:

Gebhardt, C.G., Roccia, B.A., Ceballos, Bossio, J.M., and Bossio, G.R., , "A framework for data-driven simulation of electrical circuits based on discrete-continuous optimization," submitted to IEEE Open.
